# Nonlinear Controller for Trajectory Tracking of a Haptic Robot
 This is the repository of the project "Nonlinear Controller for Trajectory Tracking of a Haptic Robot." The content of each section is as follows:
 Section #3:
 In this section, the eigen values of the nonlinear system is obtained.
 Section #4:
 In this section, the nonlienar system is linearized, and the linearized system is obtained.
 Section #6:
 In this section, a feedback linearization controller is designed for the nonlinear system.
 Section #7:
 In this section, a back-stepping controller is designed for the nonlinear system.
 Section #8:
 In this section, a sliding mode controller is designed.
 Section #9:
 In the last section, an industrial controller, which is PD, is designed.
